# Deep_Fake_Detection

With the advancement of digital manipulation technologies in today's world, the production and dissemination of fake images have increased. This situation has also led to the creation and use of fake face images. Detecting fake face images is extremely important for both security and individual privacy. In this study, pre-trained deep learning networks were used to detect and classify fake and real human faces. The project involved using three different pre-trained network architectures, and two of these networks were combined for evaluation. The pre-trained networks used were MobileNetV3-Small, MobileNetV3-Large, and ShuffleNet, with MobileNetV3-Small and MobileNetV3-Large being combined. Since the combined networks provided the most optimal accuracy, classification was performed using this network structure.
